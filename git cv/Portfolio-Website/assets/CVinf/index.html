					<h1>Personal Profile</h1>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p> I am currently in my 3rd year at Belgium Campus ITversity. I have been in the SRC(Student Reprensentitive Council) for
						2 years. I headed the Clubs department for one year and became a senior memeber the next year. I am really passionate 
						about ethical hacking. I am have a niche for Web programming as well. I am a team player and I belive myself to be a democratic leader.
						I am always willing to be given constructive critisism, as long as it will help me improve my skills and better me as a person and in life in general. 
						I enjoy conversing with people because there is a great chance of me learning something new and hopefully they learn something from me.</p>

					<h2>Security Officer</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">December 2024 - Present</p>
					<p>I work at stadiums. My employer is fidelity, I ensure that spectators don't enter the field while the game is underway.
                        This has taught me how to speak to certain groups of people and it resulted in  me having the ability to converse
						with young and old people from different ethic groups. Working for this company has also taught me punctuality and management.
